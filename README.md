# SAP HA Interface Script Connector for Pacemaker Based Cluster Setups
## Purpose
This repo provides the componnents to integrate a SAP environment managed by a [Pacemaker](https://wiki.clusterlabs.org/wiki/Pacemaker) based cluster with the HA Interface provided by SAP.

This allows that SAP instance which are manged by a cluster to be controlled by SAP management tools like the SAP MMC. Also SAP tools like SUM are able to notifiy the cluster that  during an update of an SAP instance activieties that can result in a restart of a SAP innstance which should not be acted upon by the cluster.

## Installation
  * copy the `sap_cluster_connector` script to `/usr/bin/`
  * create the directory `/usr/share/sap_cluster_connector/`
  * copy the `run_checks` script to `/usr/share/sap_cluster_connector/`
  * copy the `checks` directory and all its contents to `/usr/share/sap_cluster_connector/`

## SAP Configuration
  * add the following to the instance profile of each SAP instance that should be managed via the SAP HA interface (for example /sapmnt/RH2/profile/RH2_ASCS00_rh2ascs):  
  ```
  service/halib = $(DIR_CT_RUN)/saphascriptco.so
  service/halib_cluster_connector = /usr/bin/sap_redhat_cluster_connector
  ```
  * restart the Instance (including the sapstartsrv for that instance)
